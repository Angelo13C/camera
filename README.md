# IoT camera
This is an IoT camera that can be controlled from the [home automation](https://github.com/Angelo13C/home-automation) app that I've made (check the app to see a demo).

The firmware is based on my central [a13c-embedded](https://github.com/Angelo13C/a13c-embedded) library that I share between my firmware projects.
